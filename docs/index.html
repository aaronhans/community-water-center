    Data contained in this display represents the information available on community and non-transient non-community (specifically schools and day cares) public drinking water systems 
that are regulated by the State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board) or Local Primacy Agency (LPA). Population total does not equal the actual total served by a public water system exceeding a primary state/federal drinking water standard by analyte because a water system can be out-of-compliance for multiple analytes resulting in duplication.
