## History

The CWC is a well known, effective community activist organization. Open Oakland won a category in the <a href="https://findanewway.ca.gov/2018/11/20/cawaterdatachallenge/">CA Safe Drinking Water Data Challenge in 2018</a> with a project <a href="https://aaronhans.github.io/water-challenge/html/index.html">doing 3D representation of contaminants on a map</a>.

We started working on a new project led by water quality expert Rucker Alex who is meeting regularly with the CWC and are building tools based on the requirements of the activists. Specifications and ongoing discussions are available in the slack channel linked below.
